# Bank Account Management System
This is a Java-based console application that simulates a simple banking system where users can :<br>
<ul> <li>Create a new bank account</li>
     <li>Deposit money</li>
     <li>Withdraw money</li>
     <li>Check account balance</li>
     <li>View account details</li> 
</ul>

The project implements exception handling to manage errors such as : 
<li> Insufficient Balance – Prevents withdrawing more than the available balance. </li>
<li> Invalid Account – Ensures operations are performed only on existing accounts. </li>
